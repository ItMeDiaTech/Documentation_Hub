## Personal vs Public Documentation

**Public Documentation** (tracked in git):
- Architecture diagrams and specifications
- Implementation guides
- API documentation
- User guides
- Contributing guidelines

**Personal Documentation** (gitignored):
- CLAUDE.md files (AI assistant context)
- TODO.md, NOTES.md, SCRATCH.md
- Personal status tracking
- Developer-specific workspace files

See `.gitignore` for complete list of excluded personal files.

## Contributing

When adding new documentation:
1. Place in appropriate subdirectory
2. Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `FEATURE_NAME_implementation.md`)
3. Include date if time-sensitive (e.g., `analysis-2025-10-19.md`)
4. Update this README if adding new categories

## Maintenance

This documentation structure was created on 2025-10-19 to organize scattered markdown files and separate personal workspace files from public documentation.
