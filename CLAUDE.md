# Documentation Hub - TypeScript/Electron Desktop Application

A modern, polished desktop application built with TypeScript/Electron featuring a comprehensive document processing and session management system. This is a LOCAL application with no web deployment.

Every subfolder should have a detailed CLAUDE.md describing what each file does.

Every big change, CLAUDE.md files should be updated as needed and project should be added and committed with git.

## Release Process & GitHub Actions Workflow

### Automated Release System

This project uses **GitHub Actions** for fully automated multi-platform releases. The workflow is triggered automatically when you push a version tag.

**Workflow Location**: `.github/workflows/release.yml`

### How to Create a Release

#### Step 1: Commit Your Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message

ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

#### Step 2: Push to Master
```bash
git push origin master
```

#### Step 3: Create and Push Version Tag
```bash
# Create tag (increment version number appropriately)
git tag v1.0.X -m "Release v1.0.X - Brief description"

# Push tag to GitHub (this triggers the workflow)
git push origin v1.0.X
```

**IMPORTANT**: The tag MUST start with `v` (e.g., `v1.0.12`) to trigger the workflow.

### What Happens Automatically

Once the tag is pushed, GitHub Actions will:

1. **Build on Three Platforms**:
   - Windows (windows-latest)
   - macOS (macos-latest)
   - Linux (ubuntu-latest)

2. **For Each Platform**:
   - Updates package.json version to match the tag
   - Installs dependencies (`npm ci`)
   - Runs TypeScript type checking (`npm run typecheck`)
   - Builds the React application (`npm run build`)
   - Packages the Electron app (`npm run build:electron`)

3. **Create Installers**:
   - **Windows**: `.exe` installer + `latest.yml` (for auto-updates)
   - **macOS**: `.dmg` installer + `latest-mac.yml`
   - **Linux**: `.AppImage` + `latest-linux.yml`

4. **Create GitHub Release**:
   - Automatically creates a release on GitHub
   - Uploads all installers and metadata files
   - Generates release notes from commit messages
   - Publishes as a public release (not draft)

### Monitoring the Release

#### Using GitHub CLI
```bash
# Watch the current workflow run
gh run watch

# List recent workflow runs
gh run list --limit 5

# View specific run details
gh run view <run-id>
```

#### Using GitHub Web Interface
- **Actions Page**: https://github.com/ItMeDiaTech/Documentation_Hub/actions
- **Releases Page**: https://github.com/ItMeDiaTech/Documentation_Hub/releases

### Workflow Timing

Based on historical data:
- **Total Duration**: 3-5 minutes
- **Build Phase**: ~2-4 minutes (all platforms in parallel)
- **Release Creation**: ~30-60 seconds
- **Upload**: ~30 seconds

### Auto-Update System

The `latest.yml`, `latest-mac.yml`, and `latest-linux.yml` files enable the built-in auto-update feature:

- Users are notified when new versions are available
- Updates download in the background
- Users prompted to restart and install
- Seamless update experience across all platforms

### Version Numbering

Follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes or major feature releases
- **MINOR**: New features, backward compatible
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes and minor improvements

Current version: Check latest tag with `git tag --sort=-v:refname | head -1`

### Troubleshooting

**If the workflow fails**:
1. Check the Actions tab for error messages
2. Common issues:
   - TypeScript errors: Run `npm run typecheck` locally first
   - Build errors: Run `npm run build` locally first
   - Dependency issues: Ensure `package-lock.json` is committed

**If you need to rebuild**:
```bash
# Delete the tag locally and remotely
git tag -d v1.0.X
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.X

# Fix issues, then recreate and push the tag
git tag v1.0.X -m "Release v1.0.X - Description"
git push origin v1.0.X
```

### Manual Building (Local Testing)

To build locally without creating a release:
```bash
# Build and package for current platform only
npm run dist

# Output will be in: release/
# Windows: Documentation Hub Setup 1.0.0.exe
# macOS: Documentation Hub-1.0.0.dmg
# Linux: Documentation Hub-1.0.0.AppImage
```

**Note**: Local builds will show GH_TOKEN errors when trying to publish - this is expected and can be ignored. The installers are still created successfully in the `release/` folder.

## Core Requirements

### Design Philosophy

- **Minimalist Aesthetics**: Clean, uncluttered interface with purposeful use of whitespace
- **2025 Design Standards**: Study and surpass current leaders like Linear, Raycast, Notion, Arc Browser, and Figma desktop apps
- **Coherent Visual Language**: Consistent spacing, typography, color schemes, and interaction patterns throughout

### Technical Stack

- TypeScript for type safety
- Electron latest stable version
- React 18+ with functional components and hooks
- CSS-in-JS solution (Emotion/styled-components) or Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion for micro-interactions
- React Router for navigation

### UI Components to Implement

#### Navigation System

- Collapsible sidebar with icon-only and expanded states
- Breadcrumb navigation for hierarchical content
- Command palette (Cmd/Ctrl+K) for quick actions
- Tab system for multiple open views
- Context-aware toolbar

#### Visual Design Requirements

- **Color Scheme**:
  - Light/dark mode with system preference detection
  - Semantic color tokens for consistency
  - Subtle gradients and shadows for depth

- **Typography**:
  - Variable font with proper weight hierarchy
  - Responsive sizing using clamp()
  - Optimal line-height and letter-spacing

- **Spacing System**:
  - 4px base unit with consistent scale (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64)
  - Component-specific padding rules

- **Interactive Elements**:
  - Hover states with smooth transitions (150-200ms)
  - Focus indicators for accessibility
  - Loading skeletons instead of spinners
  - Subtle haptic feedback via animations

### Polish Details

- Custom window controls (minimize/maximize/close) matching OS style
- Blurred transparency effects using backdrop-filter
- Smooth scrolling with momentum
- Keyboard shortcuts displayed in tooltips
- Error states with graceful recovery options
- Empty states with actionable guidance
- Micro-animations on state changes (expand/collapse, appear/disappear)

### Navigation Structure

```text
Primary Navigation:
- Dashboard/Home (with active sessions)
- Sessions (grid/list view)
- Analytics
- Team
- Documents
- Plugins

Bottom Navigation:
- Notifications (with badge)
- Search (global)
- Profile
- Settings (modernized with vertical nav)

Secondary Navigation:
- Contextual actions bar
- Command palette (Cmd/Ctrl+K)
- Right-click context menus
- Keyboard navigation support
```

### Performance Requirements

- 60fps animations
- Instant perceived responsiveness (<100ms feedback)
- Virtual scrolling for long lists
- Lazy loading for heavy components
- Optimized re-renders using React.memo and useMemo

### Accessibility

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Screen reader support with proper ARIA labels
- High contrast mode support
- Reduced motion preferences respected

### Code Organization

### Implementation Priorities

1. Set up theming system with CSS variables
2. Build navigation shell (sidebar, header, content area)
3. Implement core interactive components
4. Add animations and transitions
5. Polish with micro-interactions
6. Optimize performance
7. Ensure accessibility compliance

### Reference Implementations

Study these for inspiration but create something superior:

- Linear's command palette and keyboard shortcuts
- Raycast's smooth animations and glass morphism
- Notion's flexible layout system
- Arc Browser's innovative tab management
- Figma's precise component interactions

Build every component from scratch - no placeholder code. Each element should be production-ready with proper error boundaries, loading states, and edge case handling. The final product should feel premium, responsive, and delightful to use.
